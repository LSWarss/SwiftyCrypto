## Description: 

Crypto Currency feed app, based of an app made with course by: [Swiftful Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp25X4LzOLaksp5qY0YMUzg), and then it was refactored to use more CLEAN architecture, dependency injection etc. Moreover, I've added Unit Tests for all services and core functions, planning on adding widgets and other features specified in [**issues**](https://github.com/LSWarss/SwiftyCrypto/issues) near future.
